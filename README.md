# air_Humidity_Temperature_Monitor
This project involves creating an Air, Humidity, and Temperature Monitoring System using a NodeMCU, DHT11 sensor, air quality sensor, humidity and temperature sensor, and an OLED display. The system generates real-time data and sends it to the ThingSpeak server, allowing users to monitor the environmental conditions remotely
